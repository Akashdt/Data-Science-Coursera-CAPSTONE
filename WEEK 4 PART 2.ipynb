    "To find a solution to the questions and build a recommender model, we need data and lots of data. Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyse such large dataset and produce analtics to find a solutions.\n",

    "Let's consider the base scenario : \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose i want to find a restaurant, then logically, i need 3 things :\n",
    "1. Its geographical coordinates(latitide and longitude) to find our where exactly it is located.\n",
    "2. Population of the neighborhood where the restaurant is located.\n",
    "3. Average income of neighborhood to know how much is the restaurant worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a closer look at each of these :\n",
    "1. To access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\n",
    "2. Population of a neighborhood is very important factor in determining a restaurant's growth and amount of customers who turn up to eat. Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant and less the population, less number of people frequently visit a restaurant. Also if more people visit, better the restaurant is rated because it is accessed by different people with different taste. Hence is is very important factor.\n",
    "3. Income of a neighborhood is also very important factor as population was. Income is directly proportional to richness of a neighborhood. If people in a neighborhood earns more than an average income, then it is very much possible that they will spend more however not always true with very less probability. So an restaurant accessment is proportional to income of a neighborhood."
